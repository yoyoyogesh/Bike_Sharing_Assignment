# BIKE SHARING ASSIGNMENT

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
The company want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
Business Goal:
To model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features


## Table of Contents
* Objectives
* Problem solving methodology: General Approach
* Analysis (Univariate Analysis, Bi-variate Analysis along with visual Representation)
* Subjective Questions and answers

## General Information
Identified and removed redundant and unnecessary columns from the ‘day’ data set (Bike share data set)
• Performed data cleaning on ‘day’ data sets to remove the junk data (Columns having 100% null values and rows
where the entire row is having null values) and the data which is not required for analysis
• Analyzed the variables and their different data types, also performed null value checks for the variables.
Data Cleaning and Manipulation
• Data quality issues are addressed in the right way (missing value imputation, outlier treatment and other kinds of data redundancies
• Wherever applicable, data is converted to a suitable and convenient format to work with using the right methods for e.g. categorical variables converted into dummy variables in order build the model.
• Splitting into train and test sets is done
• Rescaling is done to optimize the beta coefficients

## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.20.3
- pandas - version 1.3.4
- seaborn - version 0.11.2

## Conclusions
The top 3 features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes
1. Spring
2. Light snow
3. 2019
